<h1>Essentials of Students’ Conduct and Behaviour in the Classroom</h1>
<section id="general-conduct" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-conduct">General conduct</h2>
<p>Behave professionally – be punctual, engaged and nondisruptive in all teaching and learning sessions. Respect the physical and digital environment of the institution and our local community. Behave responsibly and respectfully. Be aware that people come from different backgrounds and cultures. Treat fellow students, staff and visitors with respect. Behave collaboratively and collegially in shared spaces – classrooms, library, computer rooms and online spaces.</p>
</section>
<section id="attendance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
<p>It is in your interests to attend; you will gain far more from your university experience if you attend classes and engage with your studies, your tutors and your classmates. There is clear evidence that those who attend classes get better results. It is also worth noting that your attendance / engagement record may be requested as part of a reference. Attendance at classes is monitored; both so that we can comply with UKVI requirements, for students on visas, and to help us identify students who may need support. We won’t ask you to explain every absence but we will contact you if your attendance / engagement raises concerns about your wellbeing. Remember to take your student card to class so that you can ‘tap in’. Do not “tap into” a class and then leave before it begins or not long into it, just to get your attendance recorded. This disturbs classes and does not benefit you in any way. It is also dishonest. We conduct manual checks of electronic attendance records and, if you are found to be falsifying your record in this way, you could be subject to a disciplinary investigation. If you can’t stay for the whole class, leave during the break, rather than disturbing others. Remember all lectures are recorded so, if you can’t attend, you can watch it at a more convenient time. If you cannot attend a small group class for some good reason you should request to attend an alternative class, where this is available. Contact your lecturer or course office for more information. Arrive on time for all your scheduled classes. Be present and in a seat, ready to begin the class at the scheduled start time. If there is a break, return promptly. If you are late: Enter as quietly as possible, and take the closest available seat so that you minimise the disturbance to others. In a lecture theatre, use the rear entrance, where available.</p>
</section>
<section id="classroom-engagement" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="classroom-engagement">Classroom engagement</h2>
<p>Prepare the work set. Whether this is reading and / or carrying out specific exercises, if you have not prepared you will not get the full benefit from the class. Being prepared benefits your group; for example, ensuring there is active discussion; or that you all play your part in the skills based classes. If you cannot prepare, for some good reason, you should let your tutor know. This may prevent you from being put on the spot when called upon to answer a question which you do not know the answer to. Engage with the class by: Taking part in any polls or quizzes / questions set by the tutor. Taking an active part in the smaller group classes. Join in with group discussions; answer the questions asked of you; listen and pay attention. If you were not able to prepare fully, or at all, pay close attention; answer or discuss any aspect you are able to. Often you will find you can take a more active part than you thought. Don’t talk during class, unless you are participating in the class. This is a distraction to other students who want to listen to the class and gain the benefit from it. You will not learn from the class if you’re talking about something else.</p>
</section>
<section id="email-communication" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="email-communication">Email communication</h2>
<p>Email is our primary means of communication with you; make sure you check your City St George’s email several times a day, especially first thing in the morning, in case there are any last minute changes to your timetable due to staff illness. Remember that email is a formal means of communication: Address all members of our community politely and formally. When emailing City St Georges staff, please include your student ID, course name and subject of query, this helps us to find you on the system and resolve your query quickly. Do not say something in an email or message that you would not say to that person’s face, or in a way that you would not want to be addressed yourself. Remember that humour or sarcasm can easily be misunderstood, especially when not accompanied by facial expressions or body language. Remember that most staff work 9-5 Monday-Friday so you are should not expect to receive a response outside these times.</p>

<section id="assessment-information" class="level1">
<h1>Assessment information</h1>
<p>Assessment Dates will be available within your Moodle Module pages, and exam dates can also be found from <a href="https://studenthub.city.ac.uk/timetabling-term-dates-exams/exams/exam-timetable">https://studenthub.city.ac.uk/timetabling-term-dates-exams/exams/exam-timetable</a>.</p>
<p>Late submission policy for coursework: Any work that is submitted more than 1 minute past the deadline but within 48 hours will have 10 marks deducted as a penalty. Work submitted after 48 hours will receive a zero.</p>
<p>​​​​​​​If you are not able to complete an assessment by the deadline there are two different options in SPGA: - <a href="https://cityuni.sharepoint.com/teams/CUoL-SASSStudentSupport/SitePages/SASS-Extensions.aspx">Extensions</a> - can be used when you need up to 1 week extra to complete coursework. - <a href="https://cityuni.sharepoint.com/teams/CUoL-SASSStudentSupport/SitePages/SASS-Extensions.aspx">Extenuating Circumstances</a> - are for when you cannot take an examination or assessment by the time of the deadline. By applying for an EC, you apply for a deferment of the assessment to the next available assessment period (normally, that would be the resit period in summer). Apply for Extenuating Circumstances via <a href="https://evision.city.ac.uk/">eVision</a> no later than 7 days after your assessment deadline</p>
<p><a href="https://studenthub.city.ac.uk/help-and-support/academic-integrity-and-misconduct">Academic Misconduct</a> – is any action that produces or seeks to produce an improper advantage for you in relation to your assessment(s) or deliberately and unnecessarily disadvantages other students. It includes, but it is not limited to plagiarism, collusion and contract cheating.</p>
<p><a href="https://studenthub.city.ac.uk/help-and-support/extenuating-circumstances-complaints-appeals">Student Appeals</a>: The appeals process is intended for the very rare cases where no resolution or remedy was possible at an earlier stage (i.e.&nbsp;prior to the Assessment Board approving the results of taught students or a decision being made regarding the registration status or examination results of research students).</p>
<p><a href="https://csgsu.co.uk/advice-and-support">Student Union Advise</a>: It is likely that if things go wrong, the University will refer you to Union Advice for advice: your first step should be to contact us to make an appointment. Please find more information from the link: <a href="https://csgsu.co.uk/advice-and-support">Advice and Support</a></p>
<p><a href="https://studenthub.city.ac.uk/timetabling-term-dates-exams/progression-and-awards">Progression and Awards</a> Important information about your assessment results, your programme and the support available to you and details of the timescales if you want to make an appeal.</p>
