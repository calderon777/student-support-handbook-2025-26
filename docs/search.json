    "text": "Attendance\nIt is in your interests to attend; you will gain far more from your university experience if you attend classes and engage with your studies, your tutors and your classmates. There is clear evidence that those who attend classes get better results.\nIt is also worth noting that your attendance / engagement record may be requested as part of a reference.\nAttendance at classes is monitored; both so that we can comply with UKVI requirements, for students on visas, and to help us identify students who may need support.\nWe won’t ask you to explain every absence but we will contact you if your attendance / engagement raises concerns about your wellbeing. Remember to take your student card to class so that you can ‘tap in’.\nDo not “tap into” a class and then leave before it begins or not long into it, just to get your attendance recorded. This disturbs classes and does not benefit you in any way. It is also dishonest.\nWe conduct manual checks of electronic attendance records and, if you are found to be falsifying your record in this way, you could be subject to a disciplinary investigation.\nIf you can’t stay for the whole class, leave during the break, rather than disturbing others.\nRemember all lectures are recorded so, if you can’t attend, you can watch it at a more convenient time.\nIf you cannot attend a small group class for some good reason you should request to attend an alternative class, where this is available. Contact your lecturer or course office for more information.\nArrive on time for all your scheduled classes. Be present and in a seat, ready to begin the class at the scheduled start time. If there is a break, return promptly.\nIf you are late: enter as quietly as possible, and take the closest available seat so that you minimise the disturbance to others.\nIn a lecture theatre, use the rear entrance, where available."

When emailing City St Georges staff, please include your student ID, course name and subject of query, this helps us to find you on the system and resolve your query quickly.\nDo not say something in an email or message that you would not say to that person’s face, or in a way that you would not want to be addressed yourself.\nRemember that humour or sarcasm can easily be misunderstood, especially when not accompanied by facial expressions or body language.\nRemember that most staff work 9-5 Monday-Friday so you are should not expect to receive a response outside these times."
